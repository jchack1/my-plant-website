# my-plant-website
In order to practice my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills I was looking for projects to build.  I decided to build a site to display my plants and tell brief stories about them. The site is responsive and works well at different screen sizes. I have also incorporated different designs and functionality at different sizes to showcase my skills, but the content remains the same. Explore the site on varying devices and sizes to get the full picture of what I can do.

This is the current link for the deployed site: https://keen-kilby-8d90d6.netlify.com
Enjoy!
